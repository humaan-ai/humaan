**Humaan** is an open-source project that empowers users and developers to run advanced AI models directly on their local machines. We aim to bring human-like AI capabilities, including Large Language Models (LLMs) and various other AI/ML models, to individual devices. Our mission is to ensure privacy, control, and accessibility for everyone by decentralizing AI and enabling users to have full control over their data and models.


## Key Features

- **Human-like AI Capabilities**: Leverage cutting-edge LLMs and AI/ML models for tasks such as natural language understanding, image recognition, speech recognition, predictive analytics, and more.
- **Privacy First**: Run models locally to ensure that your data never leaves your machine, giving you full control over how it's used, and maintaining the highest security standards.
- **Accessibility**: Designed to run efficiently on a range of devices, from desktops to more constrained hardware, making AI accessible to all.
- **Open Source**: Built with the community in mind, enabling contributions and collaborations to advance the project together. [Contribute to Humaan](CONTRIBUTING.md) by checking out our [Contribution Guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md).
- **Building for Humanity**: We prioritize AI development that benefits humanity, designing with people at the core. The interaction with AI is crafted to be transparent, intuitive, and easy to understand, ensuring that technology enhances human capability, while maintaining a focus on accessibility, ethics, and inclusivity for all users.
